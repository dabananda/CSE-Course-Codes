1. Write a program that finds the volume of different shapes (like rectangle, cylinder, cube) using function overloading.
2. Write a class to represent time that includes the member function to perform the following:
	Take input for time in hours and minutes.
	Add two times.
	Display the time in form hours: minutes.
3. Create a class called COMPLEX that has two private data called real and imaginary. Include constructor function to input real & imaginary values, show() to display complex numbers. Write a program to add two complex numbers.
4. Write a program to find the largest and smallest number between two numbers of different classes.
5. Using class write a program that would be able to do the following task:
	a) To create the vector.
	b) To add the value of a two vector
	c) To modify the value of a given element
	d) To display the vector in the form (ai+bj+ck)
6. Create a class float that contains one float data number. Overload all the four arithmetic operators for two objects.
7. Given the following base class:

	class area cl
	{
	    public:
		double height;
		double width;
	};

    Create two derived classes called rectangle and isosceles that inherit area_cl. Have each class include a function     area () that returns the area of a rectangle isosceles triangle, as appropriate. Use parameterized constructors to     initialize height and width. Write the complete program.
8. Create an abstract base class called shape. Derive class rectangle from the base class shape and a class cube from    the rectangle class.
	Data members: length, width for class rectangle height for class cube
	Member function: area(), print() for class rectangle volume(), print() for class cube
